# Enabling Sample Efficient Design Space Exploration through Machine Learning Methods

## Project Overview

Engineering is driven by effective design space exploration and optimisation. Computational tools, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD), are widely used to replace expensive physical testing by solving physical equations to provide flow field information, including surface pressure fields and velocity profiles. While these simulations provide accurate insights, they are computationally intensive and unsuitable for rapid, iterative design exploration.

One key bottleneck in accelerating design optimisation lies in the complexity of input geometries. Unstructured mesh files, point clouds, and other geometric representations do not lend themselves to simple parameterisations, making it difficult to capture and interpret the defining features of complex geometries. This high-dimensional landscape imposes significant computational burden and exacerbates the curse of dimensionality, limiting efficient design optimisation.

By developing low-dimensional representations of complex shapes, it becomes feasible to apply optimisation methods such as grid search, Monte Carlo methods, and gradient-based algorithms more efficiently. This research project will will investigate how various AI models can encode complex geometries into compact, interpretable representations to enhance design space exploration and optimisation.

Additionally, to supplement the low dimensional representations, methods for interpreting latent variables will be explored which may offer the benefit of providing insight into how navigation through an n-dimensional latent space corresponds to changes in Quantities of Interest (QoI). In Engineering, this would enable sample efficient design optisation, but also to harness this low-dimensional space guide designs towards optimal performance. 

## Project Objectives

1. **Research and Compare AI Models**: Explore and evaluate different AI approaches for encoding geometries into low-dimensional spaces, including:

   - Autoencoders (AEs)
   - Encoder-Decoders
   - Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
   - Diffusion Models
   - Implicit Neural Representation.

2. **Facilitate Design Space Exploration**: Assess how these learned representations can enable more efficient exploration of geometric quantities of interest for optimisation tasks.

3. **Analyse Geometry Representations**: Evaluate the structure, smoothness, and interpretability of the learned geometry representations and their suitability for:

   - Gradient-based optimisation
   - Genetic algorithms
   - Bayesian optimisation

4. **Optimisation Task**: Implement the learned representations on a 2D optimisation problem‚Äîspecifically, minimising the area-to-perimeter ratio. While this serves as a simplified analogy to real-world engineering challenges (e.g., optimising lift-to-drag ratios in aerospace), the methodologies can be extended to other domains.

## Why Focus on 2D Geometries?

While industry applications typically focus on 3D geometries, the computational overhead and data availability present unnecessary challenges that obscure the core research aims. By focusing on 2D shapes, this project can systematically explore and compare AI-based encoding methods without being constrained by the computational demands of 3D simulations.

## Optimisation Problem
As part of this research project, a simple optimisation problem will be used to demonstrate the limitations and principles of design space optimisation and the benefits realised by moving the optimisation  problem to a low-dimensional latent space. The optimisation problem chosen will be to minimise the perimeter to area ratio of 2D shapes. This is analogous to a more commonly optimised metric of surface-area to volume ratio which relates to heat from a solid body.

## üìè Perimeter-to-Area Ratio (P/A Ratio)

The **Perimeter-to-Area Ratio** is a geometric measure that describes the relationship between the perimeter and the area of a 2D shape. It is commonly used to analyze the efficiency of shapes in applications like heat transfer, where minimizing the ratio can reduce heat loss.

### Formula:

```
P/A Ratio = P / A
```

Where:
- **P** = Perimeter of the shape (e.g., in meters)
- **A** = Area of the shape (e.g., in square meters)

### Significance:

- **Higher P/A Ratio**: Greater heat loss (e.g., thin or irregular shapes lose heat faster).
- **Lower P/A Ratio**: Reduced heat loss (e.g., more compact shapes like circles are thermally efficient).

### Example Calculation (Circle):

For a circle with radius **r**:

```
P = 2œÄr
A = œÄr¬≤
P/A Ratio = (2œÄr) / (œÄr¬≤) = 2 / r
```

This shows that as the radius increases, the **P/A ratio** decreases, reducing the rate of heat loss.


## Significance of the Research

Generative models have become pivotal in engineering due to their ability to compress high-complexity processes into a manageable, low-dimensional search space. This research aims to:

- Identify which generative models best capture and represent complex geometries.
- Demonstrate how low-dimensional representations facilitate efficient design optimisation.
- Provide insights into interpretable and controllable geometric representations that support targeted design modification.

The outcomes of this project aim to advance the use of AI-driven geometry encoding for engineering design, offering scalable solutions for rapid and efficient design exploration.
